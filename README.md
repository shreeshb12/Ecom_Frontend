# E-commerce Product Listing and Cart System

This is a simple e-commerce application built with React and Material-UI that allows users to browse a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, and view the cart.

## Features

- **Product Details Page**: Shows additional information about a product when clicked, with an option to add it to the cart.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can view the items added to the cart, along with the total cost.
- **Persistent Cart**: The cart data persists even after refreshing the page using Redux for state management.

## Technologies Used
